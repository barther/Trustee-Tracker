# CLAUDE.md — Trustees Agenda App

## Project

Web app for the Lithia Springs Methodist Church Board of Trustees. Monthly meetings produce agendas with three sections: **Updates** (standing operational items), **Old Business** (carried-forward items needing discussion), and **New Business** (items raised since last meeting). The app replaces scattered emails and Word docs with a single system where every project has a record, every meeting captures what was decided, and the monthly agenda generates itself.

Target users: 9 trustees + pastor + lay leader + admin council chair. Not public-facing.

## Design

Visual design spec: [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md). Mobile-first "Operations Desk" direction with sage accent, Inter type, and a canonical section/status color map. All component colors and radii derive from tokens defined there — never hard-code per component.

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript, Vite
- Zustand for state management
- Microsoft Graph API for SharePoint Online list CRUD (no custom server)
- MSAL.js 2.x (`@azure/msal-browser`) for auth, single-tenant Azure AD app registration
- Static build deployed to a self-hosted web server behind Cloudflare
- PDF generation (Phase 4, not yet): jsPDF or React-PDF

## Architecture Principles

- **SharePoint lists are the data layer.** Six SharePoint lists (see schema below). MS Graph handles all reads and writes. No backend server, no database.
- **Event trail is the source of truth.** MeetingEntries are the history. `Item.Status` is derived from the most recent MeetingEntry with a non-null `StatusChangeTo`. The Item.Status column in SharePoint is a cache of that derivation, kept in sync by the app on every MeetingEntry write.
- **Zustand store hydrates from SharePoint on load, writes back on mutation.** Same pattern as the prayer-list app this is modeled after.
- **No mock data layer.** The app reads from and writes to real SharePoint lists. Seed data is provided below for initial SharePoint population, not for an in-memory fake.

## Azure Configuration

Fill these in before first run:

```
VITE_AZURE_TENANT_ID=__your_tenant_id__
VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=__your_client_id__
VITE_SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID=__your_site_id__
VITE_SHAREPOINT_LIST_ITEMS=Items
VITE_SHAREPOINT_LIST_MEETINGS=Meetings
VITE_SHAREPOINT_LIST_MEETINGENTRIES=MeetingEntries
VITE_SHAREPOINT_LIST_DECISIONS=Decisions
VITE_SHAREPOINT_LIST_ACTIONITEMS=ActionItems
VITE_SHAREPOINT_LIST_VENDORS=Vendors
```

MSAL scopes needed: `Sites.ReadWrite.All` (or `Sites.Selected` if scoped to the target site). Redirect URI: `http://localhost:5173` for dev, production URL for deploy.

## SharePoint List Schema (Finalized)

## Agenda Generator Rules

The agenda generator is a pure function. Given Items, MeetingEntries, and ActionItems, it produces a sorted agenda for a target meeting date.

Classification logic for each open item:

1. If `Status` is Closed or Declined → **skip** (do not show on agenda).
2. If `DeferredUntil` is set and is after the target meeting date → **skip**.
3. If `Status` is Tabled OR `OnHoldReason` is populated → **Tabled** subsection.
4. If `DefaultSection` is explicitly set (not Auto) → use that section.
5. If `DefaultSection` is Auto:
   - If `Standing` is true → **Updates**
   - If the item has no prior MeetingEntries → **New Business**
   - Otherwise → **Old Business**

Within each section, sort by the `SortOrder` from the item's most recent MeetingEntry, preserving last meeting's discussion order. Items without a prior entry sort to the end, then alphabetically by title.

## Patterns to Avoid

These are lessons from the prayer-list app that would be wrong here:

- **Do not use a LastUpdated field as a recency proxy.** Recency is determined by the most recent MeetingEntry date, not by any field on the Item record.
- **Do not build merge semantics.** Items are atomic. No person-linking, no merge/unmerge.
- **Do not build maintenance/pastoral visibility filters.** All MeetingEntries are visible to all users.
- **Do not build a mock data layer.** No MockDataSource, no in-memory fake. The app talks to SharePoint from day one. If SharePoint lists aren't provisioned yet, the app shows an error state, not fake data.
- **Do not use SharePoint rich text fields.** All multi-line text fields are plain text. Narratives use markdown rendered by react-markdown.

## Phased Build Plan

### Phase 1 — Item registry + agenda view (target: before May 19, 2026)

Build the minimum that makes the next monthly meeting easier:

1. **MSAL auth.** Login page, token acquisition, silent refresh. Single-tenant, redirect-based.
2. **Graph utility layer.** Generic helpers for SharePoint list CRUD via MS Graph (`/sites/{siteId}/lists/{listName}/items`). Handle pagination, field mapping between SharePoint internal names and TypeScript types.
3. **Zustand store.** Hydrate Items, MeetingEntries, and ActionItems from SharePoint on app load. Expose create/update mutations that write through to SharePoint.
4. **Agenda view (landing page).** One page. Date picker for the target meeting date (default: next third Tuesday). Renders the auto-classified agenda in four sections: Updates, Old Business, New Business, Tabled. Each item shows title, assigned-to, tags, last-discussed date, open action count, and on-hold reason if applicable.
5. **Items list view.** Searchable, filterable list of all items. Filter by status and tag.
6. **Item detail view.** Shows all item fields plus timeline of MeetingEntries (empty until Phase 2 populates them), linked Decisions, and linked ActionItems.

The SharePoint Items list will be seeded by hand from the seed data below. The app reads it live.

### Phase 2 — Meeting recording (after May 19)

- Meeting create/edit form
- MeetingEntry recording UI: for each item discussed, capture Section, Narrative, SortOrder, StatusChangeTo
- ActionItem creation inline with meeting recording
- Decision creation inline with meeting recording
- Status drift detection: if Item.Status doesn't match the most recent non-null StatusChangeTo, surface a warning

### Phase 3 — Dashboards

- Action Item Dashboard: all open actions grouped by assignee
- Decision Log: filterable by date range, amount, type, vendor

### Phase 4 — PDF + vendor roster

- Monthly agenda PDF generator
- Vendor list view with status filtering

### Phase 5 — Backfill

- Historical MeetingEntry and Decision backfill from Oct 2025 – Apr 2026 minutes

## Future: Automated agenda distribution

A Power Automate flow will eventually send the monthly agenda to all
trustees and archive it. Mirror the working **Weekly Prayer List
Generator** flow rather than building a custom renderer.

### Why HTML, not Word

`Word → PDF` is a **premium connector**. We are not paying for that
license. The prayer-list flow works around this by:

1. Storing an **HTML template** in SharePoint (`/Shared Documents/Templates/`)
   with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` slots.
2. Filling placeholders via chained `replace()` in a `Compose` action.
3. Writing the assembled HTML to OneDrive staging.
4. Using **`OneDrive: Convert file (using path)`** with `type: pdf` —
   which is a **standard** connector — to render the PDF.
5. Saving the PDF to a SharePoint document library and deleting the
   staging HTML.

Do not propose a Word template, an Azure Function, or a custom
renderer unless the licensing situation changes.

### Pattern (copy from prayer-list)

```
Recurrence (weekly, day-of-week + hour, Eastern Standard Time)
  ↓
SharePoint: Get items (Items list, filter "Status ne 'Closed' and Status ne 'Declined'")
SharePoint: Get items (MeetingEntries list, for prior-entries lookup + last narrative)
  ↓
Filter array x4   →   Select x4 (render <tr><td class="entry">…</td></tr>)
  for Updates / Old / New / (Tabled suppressed, like prayer list's empty-state)
  ↓
Compose x4 (join rows; emit "No items this section" fallback when empty)
  ↓
SharePoint: Get file content (HTML template by path)
  ↓
Compose: chained replace() to fill {{MEETING_DATE}}, {{UPDATES_ROWS}},
  {{OLD_ROWS}}, {{NEW_ROWS}}, {{OPEN_CLOSE}}, {{NEXT_MEETING}}
  ↓
OneDrive: Create file (/Agenda Staging/agenda_YYYYMMDD.html)
  ↓
Delay 15 seconds          ← required; OneDrive convert fails without this
  ↓
OneDrive: Convert file (path) → type: pdf
  ↓
SharePoint: Create file (/Agenda Archive/Trustees-Agenda-YYYYMMDD.pdf)
  ↓
Office 365 Outlook: Send email (V2) to the trustee distribution list,
  with a link to the Archive folder (same body shape as prayer-list)
  ↓
OneDrive: Delete file (staging HTML)
  ↓
[Failure path]: Send_Failure_Email → bart.arther@..., importance High,
  body explains manual fallback (reprint last month's PDF, or use chair's
  Word doc)
```

### Classification rules in Filter array

Translate the rules from `src/agenda/generator.ts` into Power Automate
expressions:

| Section | `Filter array` `where` |
|---|---|
| Skip | `equals(item()?['Status'], 'Closed') or equals(item()?['Status'], 'Declined')` — filter out before sectioning |
| Skip | `and(not(empty(item()?['DeferredUntil'])), greater(item()?['DeferredUntil'], targetDate))` |
| Tabled | `or(equals(item()?['Status'], 'Tabled'), not(empty(item()?['OnHoldReason'])))` |
| Updates | `equals(item()?['Standing'], true)` (after Tabled removed) |
| Old | items with at least one MeetingEntry where MeetingDate < targetDate |
| New | items with zero prior MeetingEntries |

`DefaultSection != 'Auto'` (manual override) should win over Standing /
prior-entries — apply it before the Standing check.

### Template placeholders

| Token | Source |
|---|---|
| `{{MEETING_DATE}}` | `formatDateTime(triggerOutputs() targetDate, 'MMMM d, yyyy')` |
| `{{MEETING_TIME}}` | `Meeting.Location ? '6 PM ' + Meeting.Location : '6 PM Living Faith Class room on 3rd floor'` |
| `{{PRIOR_MEETING_MONTH}}` | most recent Meeting where MeetingDate < target, `formatDateTime(..., 'MMMM yyyy')` |
| `{{OPEN_CLOSE}}` | `'Open/Close: ' + thisMonthName + ', ' + Meeting.OpenCloseThisMonth + ' – ' + nextMonthName + ', ' + Meeting.OpenCloseNextMonth` |
| `{{UPDATES_ROWS}}` / `{{OLD_ROWS}}` / `{{NEW_ROWS}}` | joined `<tr>` output from each section's `Select` |
| `{{NEXT_MEETING}}` | `Meeting.NextMeetingDate ?? next third Tuesday after target` |

Tabled is deliberately not in the template — the chair's typed
agendas never list it and the trustees use the app for tabled items.

### Gotchas inherited from the prayer-list flow

- **15-second `Delay`** before `Convert file` — OneDrive needs time to
  see the freshly written HTML, otherwise convert returns "not found".
- **`Send_Failure_Email`** must list every preceding action with
  `runAfter: { Failed, TimedOut }` so any single-step failure routes
  to one alert.
- HTML template lives in SP `/Shared Documents/Templates/` so the
  admin can edit it without touching the flow.

## Seed Data

### Items (24 open + 4 closed)

Use this to seed the SharePoint Items list. `FirstRaisedMeetingId` can be left null until Meetings are created in Phase 2.

## Graph API Field Mapping Notes

SharePoint Lookup fields return as `{fieldName}LookupId` (integer) in Graph responses. Multi-choice fields return as `{fieldName}@odata.type: Collection(Edm.String)` arrays. Yes/No fields are boolean. Currency fields are decimal numbers. Date fields return ISO strings.

When creating/updating items via Graph, use the internal field names with `fields` prefix:

```
PATCH /sites/{siteId}/lists/{listId}/items/{itemId}
{
  "fields": {
    "Title": "Interior Door Security Windows",
    "Status": "Open",
    "Standing": false,
    "DefaultSection": "Auto",
    "Tags": ["Security", "Building"],
    "AssignedTo": "Art Craddock, Men's Group"
  }
}
```

For Lookup fields, set `{fieldName}LookupId` to the target item's SharePoint row ID (integer).
